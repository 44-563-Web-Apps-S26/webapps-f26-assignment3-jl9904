                <p>
                    The <strong>Jaunty Lion and Judith</strong> are a duo known as much for their 
                    powerful ability to win over anyone they come in conflict with. <strong>JL</strong> 
                    possesses a majestic, golden-maned custom-made couture suit, with a stunning king's crown
                    that grants him enhanced strength and a "Sonic Roar." 
                    His sidekick, <strong>Judith</strong>, is an unsuspecting secretary but secret programmer 
                    who helps JL with his missions by using advanced hologram technology to distract opponents.
