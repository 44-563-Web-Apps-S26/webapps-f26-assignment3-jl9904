            <h2>FLO</h2>
            <p>
                FLO is an excellent British girl group that incorporates R&B throughout a new age sound that truly separates them from other rising groups. 
                They have <strong>gorgeous</strong> hits like "Soft", "Losing You", and "Shoulda Woulda Coulda", all resonating with me very well. 
                They started off with their debut single "Cardboard Box," and it was <em>fantastic</em> for not only listeners but for their trajectory in the music industry.

        <h2>INNER JOIN : SQL</h2>
        <p>
            An INNER JOIN in SQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. 
            It returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables. 
            For example, if we have a "Customers" table and an "Orders" table, an INNER JOIN would return only the customers who have placed orders.</p>
            <p>Here is an example SQL query using INNER JOIN:</p>
            <pre>SELECT column_name(s)
            FROM table1
            INNER JOIN table2
            ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;</pre>
