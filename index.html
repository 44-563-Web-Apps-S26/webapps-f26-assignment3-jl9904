            <h2>FLO</h2>
            <p>
                FLO is an excellent British girl group that incorporates R&B throughout a new age sound that truly separates them from other rising groups. 
                They have <strong>gorgeous</strong> hits like "Soft", "Losing You", and "Shoulda Woulda Coulda", all resonating with me very well. 
                They started off with their debut single "Cardboard Box," and it was <em>fantastic</em> for not only listeners but for their trajectory in the music industry.
