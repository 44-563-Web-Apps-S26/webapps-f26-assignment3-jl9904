                Though I haven't gotten the opportunity yet in my life to travel much,
                I would say my favorite place to visit was the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C.
                It had very fascinating artifacts there that were extremely enchanting to witness in person. 
                I do have pictures from my time there, however I do not have access to them as I moved them off my phone to my computer in my hometown a couple years ago. 
                Here is a photo of what the museum looks like from Google.
